# 🔍ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY #
This repository showcases my project work in Machine Learning about the prediction of **Fraud Detection in Transactions**

The contents are:
- 🗒️ _data set **Fraud_Detection_in_Transactions.csv**  which is used for analysis_  
- 🗒️ _Model deployed using Random Forest Algorithm in VS Code_
- 🗒️ _App built using Streamlit_

# 🔍ABOUT THE DATASET #
## Fraud Detection in Transactions Dataset ## 
_The Fraud Detection in Transactions dataset is made for research and experimentation to identify fraudulent financial activities. It contains transaction level data that can help train, validate, and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection._  

 ## Dataset Schema

| Column Name                  | Data Type | Description |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Transaction_ID               | object    | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| User_ID                      | object    | Unique identifier for each user |
| Transaction_Amount           | float64   | Amount involved in the transaction |
| Transaction_Type             | object    | Type of transaction (e.g., purchase, transfer) |
| Timestamp                    | object    | Date and time of the transaction |
| Account_Balance              | float64   | Account balance after the transaction |
| Device_Type                  | object    | Device used for the transaction |
| Location                     | object    | Geographical location of the transaction |
| Merchant_Category            | object    | Category of the merchant |
| IP_Address_Flag              | float64   | Indicator for suspicious IP usage |
| Previous_Fraudulent_Activity | float64   | Count of past fraudulent activities |
| Daily_Transaction_Count      | float64   | Number of transactions in a day |
| Avg_Transaction_Amount_7d    | float64   | Average transaction amount in the past 7 days |
| Failed_Transaction_Count_7d  | int64     | Failed transactions in the past 7 days |
| Card_Type                    | object    | Type of card used (e.g., credit, debit) |
| Card_Age                     | int64     | Age of the card in years |
| Transaction_Distance         | float64   | Distance between transaction origin and user’s location |
| Authentication_Method        | object    | Method used for authentication |
| Risk_Score                   | float64   | Calculated risk score for the transaction |
| Is_Weekend                   | float64   | Flag indicating if transaction occurred on weekend |
| Fraud_Label                  | int64     | Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legitimate) |

## Use Cases ##
  - _Building and evaluating fraud detection models_  
  - _Testing anomaly detection algorithms_  
  - _Exploring feature engineering strategies for financial datasets_  

## Why It Matters ##  
_Fraudulent transactions present significant risks to businesses and consumers. By using this dataset, developers and researchers can try out methods to improve the accuracy of fraud detection, reduce false positives, and strengthen financial security systems._
